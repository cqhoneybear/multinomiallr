        "Formula  $[6]$ is from [Glmnet Vignette](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html), which is actually not the standard loss function for multinomial logistic regression. In binomial case, we have 2 classes and 2-1=1 set of $\\beta$ parameters. In multinomial case, we have $K$ classes and $K-1$ sets of $\\beta$ parameters. The reason is that we always have a baseline class, and the absolute probabilities across all the other class and the baseline class should sum up to 1. Known the predicted absolute probabilities of the $K-1$ classes, we can automatically know the absolute probability of baseline class. Formula $[6]$ instead has $K$ sets of $\\beta$ parameters, which are dealed by a different solving algorithm in R package glmnet. But the property of summming up to 1 is conserved. "
